<p>So the <a href="http://planetwars.aichallenge.org" class="external">Google AI Contest</a> is over. I have finished in <a href="http://planetwars.aichallenge.org/profile.php?user_id=10047" class="external">150 place</a>, which is good, but could be better :).</p><p>The winner - <a href="http://planetwars.aichallenge.org/profile.php?user_id=8565" class="external">bocsimacko</a> - has <a href="http://quotenil.com/Planet-Wars-Post-Mortem.html" class="external">shared his algorithm and source code in his blog.</a> The same was done by the runner up - <a href="http://planetwars.aichallenge.org/profile.php?user_id=7026" class="external">_iouri_</a> - <a href="http://iouri-khramtsov.blogspot.com/2010/11/google-ai-challenge-planet-wars-entry.html" class="external">here</a>. As the two best algorithms are revealed, I will not bother with revealing my :) and start with homework - now the task is to go through at least one of them and understand all the ideas discovered and implemented.</p><p>I am looking forward to the next Google AI Challenge and this time I will prepare thoroughly to get the high place in it.</p>
