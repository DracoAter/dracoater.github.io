<p>Hardly anyone will argue, that IntelliJ IDEA is one of the best IDE for Java and Ruby(Rails). And now it is going to be free! Yes, this title is taken from <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/free_java_ide.html" class="external" target="_blank">IntelliJ Site</a>. Next version of the product will be free, and it can already be downloaded from the coerced link.
