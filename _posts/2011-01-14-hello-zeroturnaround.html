<p>A week ago I have left Axinom. Now I work in <a class="external" href="http://www.zeroturnaround.com/">ZeroTurnaround</a> - the famous home of <a class="external" href="http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/">JRebel</a>. I don't want to write about the causes that made me to do it. (Those who interested may ask in private.) The only thing I can say, that I am definitely glad :) I did it.</p>
<p>This job switch also means change of technologies I will be working with. During this week I recalled a little bit of Java and got acquainted with Maven, Ant, Hudson and Selenium (not java specific, but still something new). So look for Java related posts in the near future.</p>
