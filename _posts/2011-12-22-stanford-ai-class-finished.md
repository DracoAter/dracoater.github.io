Stanford AI class is over. I was very interesting and I learned a lot new things. Unfortunately I
sucked at the first 2 questions of final exam and my score is not so high as I would like it to be.
But there will be new interesting courses in spring - I will take my "revenge" there. So far I have
signed up to Machine Learning, Game Theory and Design and Analysis of Algorithms courses and I hope
I will have enough time for that. :)
