<p>Wave file structure is very simple. The structure can be divided into 3 parts (chunks).</p><p>First chunk:
The first 4 bytes should be "RIFF". Then come 4 bytes, which indicate the size of file. Then comes "WAVE".</p><p>Second chunk:
It starts with "fmt ". Then come 4 bytes showing the length of "fmt " chunk. Then come audio format, number of channels, sample rate, Byterate, Block align and bits ber sample.</p><p>Third chunk:
It is the audio data itself. As always 4 first bytes - name of the chunk. 4 bytes after that - the length of the chunk in bytes. After that come samples itself. 2 * number_of_channels bytes each sample.</p><p>There can be also other chunks between the first and the third, but they are really not widely used. If you got interested in it, a very good article about <a href="http://www.sonicspot.com/guide/wavefiles.html" target="_blank" class="external">"Wave file format" is on The Sonic Spot</a>.</p>

<p>So we have here an example. We see the first chunk (purple). It shows the length of the file - 0x(00 00 08 24) = 0x824 = 2084</p><p class="warning">Bytes should be read in reverse direction. First read byte has the smallest rank!</p><p>You can check yourself: left channel sample #5 = 0xE734 and right one is 0xA623.</p><br />
