<p>After upgrading your Ubuntu to Maverick, you may have experienced some problems using wireless networks. That is when your computer resumes from hibernate, it is no longer able to connect to any wireless network and only a restart will make it do it again. Also some random disconnects from wireless occur. That concerns not only Eee Pc (I have a 1000h), but I believe every computer that uses RaLink network controller. First, check if it is you :)</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ lspci -k|grep -i network --after-context 3
03:00.0 Network controller: RaLink RT2860
Subsystem: Foxconn International, Inc. Device e002
Kernel driver in use: rt2800pci
Kernel modules: rt2800pci, rt2860sta</code></pre>
<p>With Ubuntu 10.10 some hardware that was previously driven by the rt2860sta driver is now driven by default by the rt2800pci driver. Sometimes the new rt2800pci does not work as well as the rt2860sta. In that case it is often possible to switch back by blacklisting. As we already saw, we have both drivers installed and the pci one in use. Now we will create a text file that will allow us to easily switch between the drivers.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-wlan.conf</code></pre>
<p>Copy these 2 lines into the newly created file.</p>
<pre><code>blacklist rt2800pci
#install rt2860sta /bin/false</code></pre>
<p>And save. After the reboot your computer will use the rt2860sta driver. If you want to switch back to the rt2800pci driver, just comment the first line, uncomment the second and reboot.</p>
