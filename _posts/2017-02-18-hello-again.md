Hello again.

I decided to start blogging again. Somehow I felt necessary doing that not for someone else, but
for myself. It's a good way to organise my own knowledge and thoughts.

Most often you will see here info about Chef, Jenkins and DevOps - things I am working with at my
current workplace. I also moved here some relevant and not so old posts from my old blog at
[dracoater.blogspot.com](http://dracoater.blogspot.com).

Hope you will find some useful staff here.
