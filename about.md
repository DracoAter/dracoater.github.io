# About Me
I work as a infrastructure engineer at ZeroTurnaround, in Tallinn. Total experience is about 11
years (by Feb 2017), during which I had worked as software developer with (in alphabetic order):
Bash, C++, C#, Groovy, Java, MSSQL, PL/SQL, PostgreSQL, Rails, Ruby. 6 years ago I switched to
providing working infrastructure to our teams with Jenkins CI, Chef and different VM providers.
One of my hobbies is solving difficult problems, implementing some algorithms, taking part in
different programming contests.
