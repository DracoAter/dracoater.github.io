# About Me

{% avatar DracoAter %}

I work as a infrastructure engineer at ZeroTurnaround, in Tallinn, Estonia. A started my career in
2006 and worked for about 2.5 years as a Ruby on Rails developer. Next 2.5 years I worked with
C# and .Net frameworks. And now I since 2011 I am responsible for our Jenkins cluster of more than
50 machines (> 350 executors). During my work I mostly write Chef scripts in vim, manage Linux,
Windows and Mac OS X nodes, together with linux containers (lxd) and virtual machines (virtualbox).

One of my hobbies is solving difficult problems, implementing some algorithms, taking part in
different programming contests.

I also take part in organising [DevClub](http://devclub.eu) meetings.
