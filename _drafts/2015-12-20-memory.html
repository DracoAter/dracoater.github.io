<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><p>Currently we are revising our monitoring system and therefore recheck our checks and metrics that we collect from monitored servers. What we would like to know is how much memory is available in the system to start new processes. We have 3 types of servers: Ubuntu, Os X and Windows. Turned out they all use similar but different memory monitoring services and sometimes the names could be confusing.</p><p>In Ubuntu we collect metrics from /proc/meminfo - it is the source where actually all memory monitoring applications take data, such as free or vmstat. <br />
