<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><a href="" >Testing your cookbooks with unit tests</a> will help you not to break existing functionality. But how can you be sure that the recipe will successfully run on production node? The only answer to that is running this recipe on some other/similar machine and checking if everything is actually configured the way it must be. Don't worry we will not need some additional hardware for testing cookbooks, it can comfortably be done in virtual machine using <a href="" class="external">Vagrant</a>.<br />
<br />
Vagrant is a command line tool that allows you easily operate your virtual machines: create, start, halt, purge and additionally it integrates automatic provisioning with Chef, Puppet or some other tools. <br />
